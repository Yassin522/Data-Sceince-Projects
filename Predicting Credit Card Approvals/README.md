# Predicting Credit Card Approvals
This repository contains the code and data for a project that predicts whether a credit card application will be approved or not using machine learning algorithms.

# Overview
In this project, we explore how to predict credit card approvals using machine learning algorithms. We use Python and the scikit-learn library to preprocess the data, train and evaluate machine learning models, and make predictions on new data.
