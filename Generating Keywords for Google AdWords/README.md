# Generating Keywords for Google AdWords
This repository contains the code and data for a project that generates keywords for Google AdWords based on a given set of products or services.

# Overview
In this project, we explore how to generate keywords for Google AdWords based on a given set of products or services. We use Python and the pandas library to preprocess the data and generate keyword candidates. We then use the Google AdWords API to filter out irrelevant keywords and obtain search volume data for the remaining keywords.
