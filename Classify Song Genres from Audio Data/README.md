# Classify Song Genres from Audio Data
This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project that classifies song genres from audio data.

# Overview
In this project, we explore how to classify songs into different genres based on their acoustic features. We use Python and the scikit-learn library to preprocess the audio data and train several classification models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. We evaluate the performance of the models and identify the most important features for predicting song genres.
