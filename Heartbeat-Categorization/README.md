# Heartbeat-Categorization
This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model that can accurately classify heartbeats as either normal or abnormal. The model is trained on a dataset of ECG (electrocardiogram) signals, which were collected from patients and labeled by medical professionals.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6 or higher
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Keras (with TensorFlow backend)
