# Find Movie Similarity from Plot Summaries
This repository contains the code and data for a natural language processing project that finds similarity between movies based on their plot summaries.

# Overview
In this project, we explore how to use natural language processing techniques to find similarity between movies based on their plot summaries. We use Python and the scikit-learn library to preprocess the text data and train several models, including Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). We use the trained models to generate movie similarity scores and visualize the results.
