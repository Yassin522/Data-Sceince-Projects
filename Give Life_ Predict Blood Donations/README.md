# Give Life: Predict Blood Donations
This repository contains the code and data for a project that predicts blood donations using machine learning algorithms.

# Overview
In this project, we explore how to predict blood donations using machine learning algorithms. We use Python and the scikit-learn library to preprocess the data, train and evaluate machine learning models, and make predictions on new data.
