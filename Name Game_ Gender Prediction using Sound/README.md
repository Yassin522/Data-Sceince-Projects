# Name Game: Gender Prediction using Sound
This repository contains the code and data for a project that predicts the gender of a person based on the sound of their name using machine learning algorithms.

# Overview
In this project, we explore how to predict the gender of a person based on the sound of their name using machine learning algorithms. We use Python and the scikit-learn library to preprocess the data, train and evaluate machine learning models, and make predictions on new data.
