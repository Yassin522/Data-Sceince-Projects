# Na√Øve Bees: Predict Species from Images
This repository contains the code and data for a project that predicts bee species from images using deep learning.

# Overview
In this project, we explore how to use deep learning to predict bee species from images. We use Python and the TensorFlow library to preprocess the images, train and evaluate deep learning models, and make predictions on new images.
